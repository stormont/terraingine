TODO:
=====

These are "TODO" items that are more specific; i.e., not the categorical items listed in the Requirements file.
Also lists errors to be worked out.


Version 1 TODO:
- Add shaders for rendering terrain.
- Add documentation.


Version 2 TODO:
- DirectX doesn't like my index buffers for vertex rendering?
- Update vertex quad sizes *during* zoom operations.
- Add texture masking functionality.
- Enable user-selected sizes for vertex points (sprites).
- Set up texture editor.
- Add proper billboarding to vertex display.  (using a vertex shader)
- Add DirectX text display.
- Add screenshot capability.
-/ Make vertex/index buffers dynamic for TerrainPage rendering.


Dropped or Ignored For Now:
- Why do light normals on some desktops go wrong when vertex selection is disabled?
- Adjust all terrain selection/movement/etc. to the TerrainPage coordinate space.
- Dispose of all non-null TerrainPages before assigning to new value.
- Optimize terrain.
- Turn edges.
- Disabling a texture makes the next higher texture use the disabled texture's coordinates. (Discarded due to the fact that "Disable"'ing a texture to be rendered will not render all further texture stages on the device.)
