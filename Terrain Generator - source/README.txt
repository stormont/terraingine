Vertices in the TerrainPatch are ordered from the 0th vertex in the (0, 0) position to the last vertex in the (1, 1) position (using default sizes).  Vertices are also ordered by row-major order.

For example:
                  (1, 1)
     20 21 22 23 24
     15 16 17 18 19
     10 11 12 13 14
     5  6  7  8  9
     0  1  2  3  4
(0, 0)
